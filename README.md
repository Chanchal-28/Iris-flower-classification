# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

A simple machine learning project using **Scikit-learn** to classify iris flower species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`) based on their **sepal** and **petal** measurements.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset used is **[Iris.csv](Iris.csv)** containing 150 samples with the following features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
  - Species (Target)

---

## 🎯 Objective

To train a machine learning model that can **predict the species** of an iris flower using its measurements.

---

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional)

---

## 🧠 ML Model Workflow

1. Load dataset (`Iris.csv`)
2. Preprocess data
3. Split into training & testing sets
4. Train using machine learning models like:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - (Optional) KNN or SVM
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Predict iris species
